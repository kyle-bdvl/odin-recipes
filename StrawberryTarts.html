  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This free-form glazed strawberry tart in a butter-crust pastry is thickly glossed and beautiful. You can use a tart pan, but going 
    free-form is kind of fun. <br>Be sure to use perfectly ripe, sweet strawberries.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) ball sweet pastry dough</li>
  </ul>
    <h4>Sweet Cheese Mixture</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons crème fraîche</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons crème fraîche</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
  </ul>
    <h4>Strawberries:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound fresh ripe strawberries, hulled, halved</li>
  </ul>
    <h4>Glaze::</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup apricot jam</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
  <li>Place pastry dough on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out dough to a round disk about 1/8-inch thick and 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Brush outside 2 inches around the edges of circle lightly with water. Tightly curl up a bit of the edge of dough to give it a rounder shape with a slightly thickened edge. If some edges are thicker than others, pinch off excess and add to thinner edges forming a circle with even edges. Roll each 
    edge again just once to make the edges thick enough to crimp. Crimp crust with your floured fingers.</li>
  <li>Use a fork to "dock" dough's bottom surface, covering it with tiny holes to prevent dough from bubbling up as it bakes.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool about 10 minutes. Do not turn off the oven.</li>
  <li>Place cream cheese, crème fraîche, sugar, egg yolk, salt, vanilla, and lemon zest in a mixing bowl. Mix together thoroughly. Carefully pour a 
    thin layer of mixture evenly into pastry shell (you may not need all the cheese mixture).</li>
  <li>Transfer filled tart to the oven. Bake until cheese layer is set and crust is browned, about 20 minutes. Let tart cool completely to room temperature before adding berries.</li>
  <li>Arrange berries cut side down, pointy end out starting with the larger berries around the edges. You can lean strawberries up a bit as your work your way toward the center. 
    Cut some berry halves in half again to fit into any gaps on cheese layer.</li>
  <li>Place apricot jam and 2 teaspoons water in a saucepan. Heat over low heat until thin enough to brush. Let cool slightly before brushing 
    generously over all berries and crust. Transfer tart to a serving plate.</li>

</ol>
